            I'm a student but I'm also a Software Development Engineer at UPS
            through a co-op. At UPS, I help develop a web-application for tug
            drivers (worker driving a vehicle used to move packages at the UPS

            What tasks or responsibilities do you find yourself doing daily?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I study for classes and do research for my thesis most of the time.
            I meet with my thesis advisor weekly to discuss my progress,
            findings, and issues I run into. I always keep a schedule of my
            assignments as well as try to plan out times to study in my busy
            schedule. Most of the time, I'm programming the software and test my
            work. Sometimes, I have meetings discussing my progress, bugs, and
            the future of the project.

            What is your biggest work challenge?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Scheduling times to work on school work/projects is difficult
            because I'm very busy. Contacting my coworkers, especially my
            manager, when theyâ€™re busy and I need their help can be quite
            difficult especially when I'm working from home.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Do you have a hard time starting work or continuing through a
            working session?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Yes, I find it difficult to start work or stay on task as I get
            distracted easily.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            What kind of productivity apps, if any, do you use on a daily /
            weekly / monthly basis?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I use Google Calendar to schedule my school and work days as well as
            other plans which is connected to my Outlook Calendar. I use Teams
            for quick messaging and meetings, and Outlook Email for emailing. I
            use Google Drive to store my assignments and to collaborate with
            class groups.

            What features do you wish were present in current productivity apps?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I wish my current productivity apps had optimized scheduling or just
            some scheduling tool that made planning simpler. This tool would
            eliminate the time I spend trying to schedule/plan my days/weeks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            How often do you think you would use tools like scheduling and tasks
            list?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            All the time, as I mentioned that scheduling is difficult for me. A
            tasks list would ensure that I don't forget about upcoming
            assignments and studying for quizzes/tests as well as work tasks
            including important emails and deadlines.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            How often do you find yourself receiving or sending announcements in
            a group setting?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I find myself doing that very often as most of my projects are
            collaborative and require a constant stream of communication.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Do you have any interest in custom developed modules that you or
            your team would want?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            A tool that would allow me to manage a series of code repositories
            would be helpful, similar to Github and AzureDevOps. Regarding my
            thesis, a tool for keeping track of my sources used would be nice to
            keep my set of sources organized.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Would you or your team make use of customizable dashboards /
            toolsets?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Yes, it would be nice to be able to see data on my projects on a
            homepage which would be something I'd customize my dashboard for.
            For example, a chart for if a database has failed or number of users
            would be nice.
          </p>

            What features do you wish were part of our product that we have not
            mentioned previously?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Optimized scheduling where the system would recommend
            study/free/etc. time for gaps in my schedule. Also, if I could give
            the system a list of tasks (such as assignment or work tasks) with
            importance rating and time needed to complete, and it would
            automatically recommend an optimal schedule to complete these tasks.
            Announcements where the announce can check if they read an
            announcement and the announcer gets feedback to make sure their team
            got the important message/info.
