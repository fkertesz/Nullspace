            As a compliance analyst, I want to create a task list with deadlines
            for each project phase, so I can ensure timely completion and meet
            all compliance requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want to be able to add an estimated
            completion time to tasks, so I can plan out enough time for each
            task.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a busy professional, I want to receive reminders a set number of
            days before each deadline, so I can stay on track and avoid
            last-minute, rushed work.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a user, I want to automatically prioritize my tasks by urgency,
            so I can plan to complete urgent tasks first.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want to organize tasks into project

            rushing to get things done before a pressing deadline.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want the scheduling module to suggest
            efficient task order, allowing me to balance workload across all
            deadlines and priorities.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a working user, I want the flexibility to adjust deadlines or add
            new tasks as projects change, ensuring my schedule remains current.
