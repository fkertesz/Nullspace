            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want the scheduling module to suggest

            <br />
            As a user and analyst, I want to search for past announcements,

            As a compliance analyst, I want to archive old announcements,

            As a user, I want to be able to have custom tools, so VectorSpace is
            integrated into all aspects of my work and I can have most if not
            all tools all in one app.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want an automated tracking system that
            monitors regulatory updates, so I can stay up-to-date on industry
            standards.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want a dedicated dashboard to organize
            regulatory updates, so it is easier to track all compliance
            requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a user, I want flagged updates that directly affect my projects
            to stand out, so I can prioritize important changes.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want the tracker to filter updates by
            relevance, so I only see changes that apply to my work.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want a visual timeline of my project
            tasks, helping me to view my progress and adjust my schedule
            accordingly.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want the dashboard to display summaries
            of recent regulatory changes, so I can grasp new requirements
            quickly and effectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance analyst, I want the system tracker to log all
            tracked updates, so I can easily reference past changes for auditing
            purposes.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a compliance professional, I want update notifications to include
            links to full regulatory documents, so I have quick access to
            complete information.
