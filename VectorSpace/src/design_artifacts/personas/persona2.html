            Lawrence, a computer science student and software developing
            engineer
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            <br />
            Lawrence, age 23, is a software developing engineer who is
            completing his Master's in computer science at the University of
            California. He works at Facebook where he develops a website and
            works about 30 hours a week. He was born and raised in California
            and still lives there. He is completing the last semester of his
            Master's in Computer Science. He works both from home and at the
            office but prefers working from home as he hates commuting and likes
            working with his cats around. Despite his packed routine, Lawrence
            makes time for spending time with friends and sometimes dabbles in
            independent coding projects. Heâ€™s driven but often finds himself
            juggling responsibilities and deadlines across school and work with
            his busy schedule.

            <br />
            <br />
            Lawrence is very involved in technology as it is the core of his
            career. He is quite familiar with the general Microsoft app line as
            well as more computer science-leaning applications. He relies on
            Google Calendar and Outlook to schedule his days/weeks and stay
            organized. Teams is his go-to for quick messaging and meetings at
            work, and he stores assignments and group projects in Google Drive
            for effective collaboration. With a focus on efficiency, Lawrence
            wishes he could simplify his planning processes with an optimized
            scheduling tool that could recommend time slots for studying and
            thesis work. A personalized dashboard with real-time project stats
            and a repository management tool would help him oversee the progress
            of his collaborative and work projects. These features would help
            him stay on top of assignments and work tasks, even during busy
            weeks.
