            Lawrence's scenario: Optimizing school and work schedule
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            <br />
            With his finals and thesis defense approaching, Lawrence wants to
            ensure that he has time to study even with his busy work schedule.
            He wants to make sure he has time to work on homework and final
            projects, prepare for his thesis presentation, and also have time to
            study for final tests. Lawrence opens VectorSpace's optimized
            scheduling module where he enters his list of tasks with their
            priority, estimated completion times, and deadlines. The system
            quickly gives him the most efficient schedule where it inserts in
            times to study for each task such that he has sufficient time to
            complete them and it is before the deadline. Lawrence thinks this
            schedule is great and is happy that he saved time with the system
            and didn't feel overwhelmed by all the tasks he needed to schedule.
            He follows this schedule for the next couple of weeks which allows
            him to complete his tasks on time and stress-free because he didn't
            need to worry about missing a deadline or working on something very
            last minute.

            Lawrence's scenario: Staying productive
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            <br />
            Lawrence often struggles with staying productive while working both
            from home and at the office because his coworkers send him lots of
            messages or approach him a lot with questions or updates. To avoid
            these distractions and not be interrupted often, Lawrence turns on
            the focus mode on VectorSpace. This allows messages to still come
            through but not notify Lawrence every time, and also allows other
            coworkers to see his status and not approach him. However, if a
            person marks a message as urgent, Lawrence gets the message and can
            address it. Additionally, Lawrence uses task blocks in focus mode
            where he takes breaks between tasks to avoid burnout. Because he is
            not being constantly distracted, Lawrence is able to get through
            some programming uninterrupted, allowing him to stay productive and
            deliver quality and swift work.

            Lawrence's scenario: Organizing thesis work
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            <br />
            Lawrence is working on his Master's thesis that involves using a lot
            of sources. He really struggles with keeping track of his sources as
            well as why he is referencing each. He opens VectorSpace and creates
            a custom module where he can attach the PDF's of all his sources and
            can optionally add a summary to each as well or other notes. This
            allows Lawrence to quickly reference and search his notes for key
            arguments in certain texts especially since all sources are in one
            place. He also tags each source with keywords that he can use to
            find a source when he doesn't remember which source he needs for a
            certain topic. By organizing his sources, Lawrence is saving time
            and feeling more organized and overall more productive with his
            thesis process.
