          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I am a Compliance Testing Analyst at Republic Bank, so I I analyze
            internal processes, test compliance with regulatory standards, and
            report any findings or risk areas.

            What tasks or responsibilities do you find yourself doing daily?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            On a typical day, I review and test various compliance processes,
            monitor new regulations, and ensure that our internal policies align
            with the latest requirements. I document test results, identify
            compliance gaps, and often work with other departments to address
            any issues that come up. Communication is definitely a big part of
            my job, as I need to share compliance findings and ensure my team
            understands them.

            What is your biggest work challenge?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            One of my biggest challenges at work is managing multiple testing
            projects simultaneously, especially as regulations can change
            suddenly, requiring immediate updates to our processes. Balancing
            these projects requires strict time management, as well as the
            ability to prioritize tasks that carry the most potential risk to
            the bank.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Do you have a hard time starting work or continuing through a
            working session?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Starting a session can sometimes be challenging, especially when
            tackling large reports or documentation, which require a lot of
            focus. However, once I get into the work, Iâ€™m generally able to
            maintain momentum, especially if I break tasks down into smaller,
            manageable portions and use productivity tools to stay organized.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            What kind of productivity apps, if any, do you use on a daily /
            weekly / monthly basis?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            My team uses Microsoft apps, so we use Teams for communication and
            coordination, especially for quick check-ins. I use Excel for data
            analysis and managing large volumes of compliance data.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            What features do you wish were present in current productivity apps?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I struggle with keeping up with deadlines for each project and not
            losing important messages and updates in long message chains, so
            those features would be very useful. Announcements and reminder
            features would be nice as well for important messages and such.
            Also, a more specific feature I could use would be an automated
            update system for any regulatory changes relevant to our banking.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            How often do you think you would use tools like scheduling and tasks
            list?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            I would use scheduling and task lists all the time. Scheduling helps
            me prioritize high-impact tasks, and task lists are essential for
            breaking down complex projects into actionable steps as well as not
            forget about important tasks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            How often do you find yourself receiving or sending announcements in
            a group setting?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Several times a week - I receive/send announcements related to
            regulatory changes, internal policy updates, and project status
            updates all the time. Communication is key in compliance, as
            everyone needs to be informed about changes to ensure policies are
            followed. However, doing this is harder without a feature in the
            apps we use.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Do you have any interest in custom developed modules that you or
            your team would want?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Yes, I'd really like the automated update system for regulatory
            changes I talked about.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            Would you or your team make use of customizable dashboards /
            toolsets?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Yes, I'd find them really useful for making sure we can monitor key
            compliance indicators in real-time, like any flagged compliance
            issues or pending deadlines. We could also use these dashboards to
            manage team-specific goals and track progress toward monthly or
            quarterly compliance targets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl uppercase text-[#752936] font-bold">
            What features do you wish were part of our product that we have not
            mentioned previously?
          </h2>
          <p class="mx-5 text-lg italic">
            Going off of the automated regulation tracker, I think a feature
            that could enhance the product would be a centralized information
            tracker that compiles important updates relevant to a teamâ€™s focus.
            Also, a live reporting tool with customizable templates would make
            it easier to compile and share information, helping us stay
            organized, report to higher-ups, and not waste time on long
            meetings.
